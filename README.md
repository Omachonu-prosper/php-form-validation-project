# php-form-validation-project
A test project to validate user input using php

## Getting started

To start development on your local machine you need 
* A LAMP, WAMP or MAMP server like XAMPP
* To clone this github repo
* Navigate to index.php (the location for this file would be different depending on the development server you opt for (XAMPP or otherwise))

That should be all

## Issues
If you encounter any problems while setting up your server or a bug in the code you should create a github issue. This would make us aware of the issue you faced and how we could help in fixing it.
